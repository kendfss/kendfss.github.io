### Kenneth
self:
```
Occasional purveyor, and avid consumer, of steppers, rollers, and bouncers, alike.
Burgeoning API author.
Overwhelmingly vicarious Abomunist.
Currently non-local North Weezer.
Not strictly in that order.
According to Joe Nice, my dubstep is quite bad. Though apparently it makes pleasing car music.
